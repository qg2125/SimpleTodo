## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

* Challenge 1. At first I could only see the design view of activity_main.xml, rather than the code view. This problem was solved when watching the tutorial videos. 
* Challenge 2. A problem reported when using class FileUtils and method readLines. Later, I figured out that I typed the name of commons-io library in the wrong way.
